# AI-Powered-Conversational-Chat-Platform-Built-with-Streamlit-and-Gemini
This project is an AI-powered conversational web application built using Streamlit and Google Gemini. It allows users to ask questions and receive intelligent, real-time answers through an interactive chat interface, supporting continuous conversations until the user ends the session.

# 🤖 AI Question–Answer Chat App (Streamlit + Google Gemini)

This is my **first Large Language Model (LLM) project**, where I developed an interactive AI-powered chat application using **Google Gemini** and **Streamlit**.  
The app allows users to ask any question and receive smart, meaningful answers instantly. It supports **continuous chatting** until the user ends the session, making it feel like a personal AI assistant.

## 🚀 Features
- ✔️ Ask any question & get instant responses
- ✔️ Continuous conversation with chat memory
- ✔️ Simple and user-friendly Streamlit UI
- ✔️ “End Chat” button to stop conversation
- ✔️ Works smoothly in Google Colab
- ✔️ Beginner friendly implementation

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
During this project, I learned:
- 🔹 What LLMs (Large Language Models) are and how they work  
- 🔹 How to integrate Gemini API in Python  
- 🔹 How to build web apps using Streamlit  
- 🔹 Handling chat conversation state in applications  
- 🔹 Deployment concepts using Colab + Tunnels  
- 🔹 Debugging API errors and handling responses  

This project helped me gain confidence to work with **AI, APIs, and Web Apps together**.

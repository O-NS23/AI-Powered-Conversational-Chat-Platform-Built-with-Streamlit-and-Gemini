            "3.  **Keywords:** Scan job descriptions for common skills and terms and incorporate them naturally into your resume.\n",
            "4.  **Action Verbs:** Start bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., Developed, Implemented, Analyzed, Optimized, Designed, Modeled, Built).\n",
            "5.  **Quantify Everything:** Whenever possible, use numbers, percentages, or metrics to show the impact of your work (e.g., \"Increased accuracy by 15%\", \"Processed 500GB of data\", \"Reduced query time by 20%\").\n",
            "6.  **Proofread Meticulously:** Typos and grammatical errors instantly convey a lack of attention to detail. Get someone else to read it.\n",
            "7.  **Tailor Your Resume:** Customize your resume for *each* job application. Highlight skills and projects most relevant to that specific role.\n",
            "8.  **Clean & Consistent Formatting:** Use consistent fonts, sizes, and spacing. Readability is key.\n",
            "\n",
            "**What to Avoid:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Photos:** Generally not required in the US/UK and can introduce bias.\n",
            "*   **Irrelevant Hobbies:** Unless they directly showcase a relevant skill (e.g., \"Competitive chess player - demonstrates strategic thinking\").\n",
            "*   **Personal Pronouns:** Avoid \"I,\" \"my,\" \"me.\"\n",
            "*   **Salary Expectations.**\n",
            "*   **References available upon request:** This is assumed.\n",
            "\n",
            "By focusing on your academic foundation, technical prowess, and practical application through projects, you can build a compelling resume even as a fresher. Good luck!\n"
